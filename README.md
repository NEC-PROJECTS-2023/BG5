Introduction:
The explosive growth of health-related data presented unprecedented 
opportunities for improving health of a patient. Heart disease is the dominant reason for 
mortality in India, Australia, UK, USA, and so on. Machine learning involves and activates the 
uncovering new trends in healthcare industries. By using machine learning technique we can 
conduct the research from different aspects between heart diseased persons and healthy person 
based on the existing medical considerable datasets. Tremendous approach in this study of all 
cardiac-related disease classification is done to find the disguised medical information. It 
accelerated the establishment of vital knowledge, e.g., patterns, different dimensions for 
identifying relationships amidst medical factors interconnected with heart diseases.
 By using some machine learning techniques, heart disease prediction can be made 
simple by using various characteristics to find out whether the person suffers from heart attack or 
not, and it also takes less time to predict and improve the medical diagnosis of diseases with 
good accuracy and minimizes the occurrence of heart attack. It assists to resolve the hidden 
reason and diagnose the heart diseases efficiently even with the uncertainties and inaccuracies. 
This paper emphasizes the machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Random 
Forest, boosted tree, stochastic gradient boosting and support vector machines that are used to 
confirm the best prediction technique in terms of its accuracy and error rate on the specific 
dataset.
